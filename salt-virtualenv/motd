Hello, welcome to this nifty little build container! Aliases have been set up
to make building packages super easy. To build, just run:

build-<release>-<arch>

Replace <release> with the RHEL/CentOS release (5, 6, or 7), and replace <arch>
with the OS architecture (either x86_64 or i386). So, for example, to build
for 64-bit CentOS 5, you would run:

build-5-x86_64

To build for RHEL/CentOS 7 (which has no 32-bit release) you would run:

build-7-x86_64
